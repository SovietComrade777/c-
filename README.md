Hi there i am akshat here .
I am just doing up with my c.
these problems are listed on w3 schools c language practice problems(Hence all credit to them)
These problems are the ones which i felt like they are better than other and in comparison with other these problems are far better than others listed there.
I posted this content here so that i could figure out which which things or methods i know for any situation.
These programs are compiled and runned once and they didn;t gave any type of error so the code posted here is correct.
Thank you if you are checking them out.
#*These problems are selected from 150 problems
